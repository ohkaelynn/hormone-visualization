# Hormonal Health Tracker

The **Hormonal Health Tracker** is a tool to track and visualize hormone levels over time. It helps you:

- Track hormone changes over time.
- Visualize trends in hormone levels with interactive plots.
- Monitor changes in hormones using emojis to represent increases, decreases, or stability.
- View a responsive, user-friendly table that displays reference ranges, the latest hormone results, and their changes.

## Features

- **Interactive Plots**: Visualize hormone levels over time for any individual hormone or a selection of hormones.
- **Change Tracking**: Track changes in hormone levels from one measurement to the next, displayed using emojis (e.g., üìà for increases, üìâ for decreases, ‚û°Ô∏è for no change).
- **Reference Table**: See a comprehensive table with the latest hormone results compared to reference ranges (e.g., Cis Female, Cis Male).
- **Easy to Use**: The application is designed to be user-friendly, making hormone tracking simple and intuitive.

## How it Works

1. **Upload Your Data**: Provide your hormone level measurements in a CSV format.
2. **Track Trends**: The app will process your data, displaying trends and changes over time with visual aids.
3. **View Results**: The application will show the current values of hormones, compare them against reference ranges, and indicate the status of each hormone with emojis representing increases, decreases, or neutral changes.

## CSV Format

To use the tracker, your data should be in the following format:

```
Date,Hormone,Value
2025-01-01,Estradiol,120.5
2025-01-01,Testosterone,1.2
2025-01-01,Progesterone,2.5
2025-02-01,Estradiol,125.3
2025-02-01,Testosterone,1.3
```

- **Date**: The date of the hormone measurement.
- **Hormone**: The name of the hormone (e.g., Estradiol, Testosterone).
- **Value**: The numerical value of the hormone level at that point in time.
